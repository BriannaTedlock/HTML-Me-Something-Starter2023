  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Background</h1>
  <p>It all started when I found a helpless kitten at a gas station near my house. He was going from person to person begging for help and they treated him like he was pest and tried to shoo him out of the gas station. He was maybe 4 weeks old and no Mama in sight. I couldn't bear to leave the kitten alone, so him brought him home with me. My roommate immediately fell in love and adopted the little guy.</p>
  <p>A few weeks later I found another kitten by my house stuck in a fence. I brought him inside and searched and searched for his Mama with no luck. He stole my heart very quickly and I couldn not help but adopt the little sweetheart.</p>
  <p>Another few weeks go by when my roommate and I start to hear faint meows around our house, knowing it was likely more kittens we started to put out food to help them. We had seen multiple neighborhood cats in the area and figured one of them must be the mama. However mc the food attracted more cats to our porch than we expected. It wasn’t long before we discovered the kittens were living under our porch. It wasn’t safe for them considering the amount of cat killing dogs lurking in our neighborhood. We quickly realized that we needed to save the kittens before they were old enough to start running the neighborhood on their own.</p>
  <p>We took the kittens to a vet where we learned about their TNR clinic, the kittens  received medical care and were advised to try and get the mama as they were too young to be away from her yet. We managed to get her after multiple failed attempts and gave her a nice room with all the cat amenities to properly care for her babies. </p>
  <p>It didn’t take long before we found another cat from her colony with kittens about the same age, we put them together where they happily co-parented. We even gained both their trust and became friends with them! It took some time but we did find happy homes for each kitten. We knew the mamas missed their colonies and they simply weren’t fit for adoption.</p>
  <p>From there, we started researching what to do for them and for future kittens and discovered the TNR program (Trap-Neuter-Return) which aims to reduce the number of stray cats on the streets.</p>
  <p>For a small fee both Mama cats were fixed, microchipped, and received their shots. They tipped their ears to show they were TNR cats and not strays, and we let back out rejoin their colony. The food we had been putting out had attracted their colony right to our porch and we couldn't just ignore them, so we decided to trap them and take them to a TNR clinic.</p>
  <p>Word spread about our efforts, and eventually, people on social media started reaching out to us for help with the kittens they found. We became known as the go-to people for helping stray kittens in your area. It was a lot of hard work, but we found it incredibly fulfilling to help these animals and make a positive impact on your community. To date we have rescued and found homes for over 60 cats and kittens.</p>

  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Life Outside</h1> 
    <p>A kitten born outside faces many challenges and struggles for survival. These kittens are often born to feral cats or to cats that have been abandoned or lost. They are known as community cats, and they form colonies of cats that live together in outdoor habitats.
  The chances of survival for these kittens are low, as they are vulnerable to disease, starvation, and predation. They may also suffer from injuries, such as broken bones, and can face harsh weather conditions. Without human intervention, their life expectancy is relatively short.
  Kittens born outside may not have the opportunity to learn to trust and love humans, as they are not socialized to humans at a young age. However, with patience, love, and proper socialization techniques, it is possible to build a relationship with these cats and even adopt them into loving homes.</p>
 
  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Community Cats</h1>
  <p>It is essential to treat community cats with love and compassion, as they are sentient beings that deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Community cats can benefit from TNR programs, which help to control their population and prevent the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild.
  In summary, kittens born outside face many challenges and struggles for survival. They form colonies of cats that live together in outdoor habitats known as cat colonies. 
  <br><br>Without human intervention, their life expectancy is relatively short. It is essential to treat community cats with love and compassion and to provide them with the care they need to live healthy and happy lives.</p>
  
  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Trap-Neuter-Release</h1>
  <p>TNR, or trap-neuter-release, is an important method for controlling the population of feral cats. Feral cats are domestic cats that have returned to the wild and are not socialized to humans. TNR works by humanely trapping these cats, having them spayed or neutered, and then releasing them back into their environment. This approach helps to manage the population of feral cats without resorting to euthanasia, which can be cruel and ineffective.
  TNR, or trap-neuter-release, is an important method for controlling the population of feral cats and preventing the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild. Feral cats are domestic cats that have returned to the wild and are not socialized to humans. They can suffer from starvation, disease, and injury, and their population can quickly become unmanageable.
  TNR not only helps to prevent the suffering of feral cats but also benefits the community and domestic cats. By reducing the population of feral cats, TNR can help reduce the incidence of cat-related problems such as noise, odor, and property damage. It can also reduce the risk of disease transmission between cats, including diseases that can be transmitted to humans.</p>
 
<h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>Getting involved in TNR is a great way to help cats in need. You can start by contacting local animal shelters or rescue organizations to find out if they have a TNR program. If there isn't a program in your area, consider starting one yourself. TNR requires some training and resources, but there are many resources available to help you get started. By participating in TNR, you can help prevent the suffering of countless innocent kittens and improve the lives of feral cats in your community.
  In summary, TNR is an essential method for managing the population of feral cats and preventing the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild.</p>
