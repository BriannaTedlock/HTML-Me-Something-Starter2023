  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Background</h1>
  <p>
  Found a kitty at a gas station..
  
  Then in a fence..
  
  Then under the porch...
  </p>
 
  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Life Outside</h1> 
  <p>A kitten born outside faces many challenges and struggles for survival. These kittens are often born to feral cats or to cats that have been abandoned or lost. They are known as community cats, and they form colonies of cats that live together in outdoor habitats.
  The chances of survival for these kittens are low, as they are vulnerable to disease, starvation, and predation. They may also suffer from injuries, such as broken bones, and can face harsh weather conditions. Without human intervention, their life expectancy is relatively short.
  Kittens born outside may not have the opportunity to learn to trust and love humans, as they are not socialized to humans at a young age. However, with patience, love, and proper socialization techniques, it is possible to build a relationship with these cats and even adopt them into loving homes.</p>
 
  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Community Cats</h1>
  <p>It is essential to treat community cats with love and compassion, as they are sentient beings that deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. Community cats can benefit from TNR programs, which help to control their population and prevent the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild.
  In summary, kittens born outside face many challenges and struggles for survival. They form colonies of cats that live together in outdoor habitats known as cat colonies. Without human intervention, their life expectancy is relatively short. It is essential to treat community cats with love and compassion and to provide them with the care they need to live healthy and happy lives.</p>
  
  <h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>Trap-Neuter-Release</h1>
  <p>TNR, or trap-neuter-release, is an important method for controlling the population of feral cats. Feral cats are domestic cats that have returned to the wild and are not socialized to humans. TNR works by humanely trapping these cats, having them spayed or neutered, and then releasing them back into their environment. This approach helps to manage the population of feral cats without resorting to euthanasia, which can be cruel and ineffective.
  TNR, or trap-neuter-release, is an important method for controlling the population of feral cats and preventing the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild. Feral cats are domestic cats that have returned to the wild and are not socialized to humans. They can suffer from starvation, disease, and injury, and their population can quickly become unmanageable.
  TNR not only helps to prevent the suffering of feral cats but also benefits the community and domestic cats. By reducing the population of feral cats, TNR can help reduce the incidence of cat-related problems such as noise, odor, and property damage. It can also reduce the risk of disease transmission between cats, including diseases that can be transmitted to humans.</p>
 
<h1><i class = 'fas'>&#xf1b0;</i><br>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>Getting involved in TNR is a great way to help cats in need. You can start by contacting local animal shelters or rescue organizations to find out if they have a TNR program. If there isn't a program in your area, consider starting one yourself. TNR requires some training and resources, but there are many resources available to help you get started. By participating in TNR, you can help prevent the suffering of countless innocent kittens and improve the lives of feral cats in your community.
  In summary, TNR is an essential method for managing the population of feral cats and preventing the suffering of kittens and cats in the wild.</p>
